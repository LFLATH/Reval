Reval: Revalute your land usage

Land is an increasingly scarce resource. If you own land you should be using it as efficiently as possible. Additionally, if you are looking to purchase land you should buy a piece of land that has a possibility for high returns. Our project, Reval, allows users to select a price of land from a map and view the estimated price, based on county by county acerage pricing, and see the amount of money they would spend and later earn from building a solar farm there. While solar farming isn't the only avalabile option, we thought it would serve as a good proof of concept.
